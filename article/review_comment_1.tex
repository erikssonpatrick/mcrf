\section{General comments}

\subsection*{Reviewer comment 1}

1. As noted in Section 4.2.4, the a priori assumptions do not describe reality
very well. In particular, I suspect that the information content of Dm and N0* is
highly dependent on the a priori assumptions of these two variables in the
retrieval framework. Especially with a radar measurement, since Z is sensitive to
both parameters over a wide range of the parameter space, the relative
sensitivity and therefore information content willalmost entirely depend on the
relative constraints on these parameters imposed by Xaand Sa. As such it is
imperative to accurately characterize these. I understand the choice to use the
DARDAR constraints, but it’s clear from the cross-section plots thatthe model
ice particle concentrations vary over a much wider range than the roughly2
orders of magnitude that Eq. 4 provides over a 220-272 K temperature range.
So, when the retrieval results are compared to model “reality”, it seems that a
lot of N0* variability is folded into Dm and this is especially evident in
Figures 13 and 14. My overall concern is that it is difficult to interpret some
of the results when the modelfields and the a priori assumptions differ so
strongly.

\subsubsection*{Author response:}

It should be clarified here that Eq. (4) only gives the variation of the mean
profile of the a priori for $N_0^*$ and that the standard deviation for $N_0^*$
has been set to a value of $2$ in log-space, allowing $N_0^*$ to vary over several
orders of magnitude.

Nonetheless, the point raised by the referee remains valid. Since the topic
of the study are synergies between radar and radiometer observations, we aimed
to keep the a priori assumptions realistic (the DARDAR mean profile) but at the
same time sufficiently loose (high std. dev.) in order to not introduce information
a priori that may be provided by the synergy. To clarify this, the following
lines haves been added in the introduction:

\textit{The standard deviations in the covariance matrix have been deliberately
  chosen to be very loose in order avoid the introduction of constraining
  information that may be provided by the radiometer observations.}

\subsection*{Reviewer comment 2}

Forward model error is introduced when the different species present in the
model microphysics are combined into one species and when different scattering
models are used to represent the ice particles. That this is not represented in
Se could lead to over-fitting and poor convergence (I suspect this is part of
the reason why the normalized cost is much higher for the radiometer-including
retrievals). It should be relatively easy to quantify this error by re-running
the simulations with the retrieval assumptions(combining ice species, different
scattering models), and I suspect that this error term would dominate the
instrument noise term for many channels.

\subsubsection*{Author response}

This is certainly another valid point and has been addressed in the way suggested
by the authors. All calculations were repeated and the corresponding results
updated in the manuscript. To clarify this a sub-section specifying the assumed observation
errors has been added to Sect. 2.3..

\section{Specific comments}

\subsection*{Reviewer comment 1}
Lines  85-88:   I  recommend  the  use  of  geographical  spatial  references  (i.e.,north/south rather than left/right)

\subsubsection*{Author response}
This has been fixed in the updated version of the manuscript.

\subsection*{Reviewer comment 2}
Line  98  (also  176,252,449):  Instead  of  vertical/horizontal  (which  are  dependentone the convention used for plotting), I recommend the use of concentration/size tocharacterize the dimensions of the particle size distribution.

\subsubsection*{Author response}
This has been fixed in the updated version of the manuscript.

\subsection*{Reviewer comment 3}

Line 100: A few more details on the Milbrant and Yau microphysics sheme that arerelevant to this study would be helpful here. For example: What is the assumed shape(functional form) of the particle size distribution, and what are the prognostic variables(e.g., number concentration, mixing ratio)?

\subsubsection*{Author response}

The comment has been addressed by adding the following explanation to the manuscript:


\subsection*{Reviewer comment 4}
Line 135: Does the ARTS radar solver also provide analytic Jacobians?

\subsubsection*{Author response}
Yes, it does. This is now also mentioned in the description of the retrieval forward model.

\subsection*{Reviewer comment 5}
Line 187: “particles” should be “particle”

\subsubsection*{Author response}
This will be corrected in the manuscript.

\subsection{Reviewer comment 6}
Line 198: Is Dm also only retrieved at these 10 points, or just N0* (and Dm retrievedin each radar range gate as in Grecu et al. 2016)?

\subsection{Reviewer comment}
7.  Line 256:  Actually, this is only one example of how the radar and radiometer measurements can be complementary.  Even if the lines were parallel (and thus no infor-mation distinguishing size from concentration could be obtained), the radar still locatesthe cloud and describes its vertical structure.  One can imagine a cloud of the sameice water path and particle size at two different heights having different brightness tem-peratures due to changes in the water vapor absorption above the cloud – having theradar information would provide increased information content about the ice water pathin this case than the radiometer measurement alone.

\subsubsection*{Author response}
Although this is certainly one advantage of combining radar and radiometer
observations, the authors would not consider this a true synergy of the active
and passive observations since correctly locating the cloud in the atmosphere is
something that the radar can do alone. For the passive to add benefit to the
radar , the combined observations must provide additional information on the
microphysics that the radar alone does not provide. To better clarify this
reasoning the following sentence will be added to the manuscript:

\subsection*{Reviewer comment 8}
Table 4: Why are the values for GemSnow and GemGraupel different than in Table1?

\subsubsection*{Author response}

The differences in the reported values for GemSnow and GemGraupel were due to a mistake
made by the authors. The values will be corrected in the updated version of the manuscript.

\subsection*{Reviewer comment 9}
Figures 7 and 8:  I’m not sure why these are separate figures – it seems like allpanels could fit on one page.

\subsubsection*{Author response}
The figures will be combined into a single figure.

\subsection*{Reviewer comment 11.}
 Line 374: recommend using “represent” instead of “predict”

\subsubsection*{Author response}
The proposed change will be adopted in the updated version of the manuscript.

\subsection*{Reviewer comment 12}
 Line 382: should be “reference” instead of “references”

\subsubsection*{Author response}
This will be corrected in the updated version of the manuscript.

\subsection*{Reviewer comment 13}

Line  414:  How  are  the  truncated  PSDs  (using  GemSnow)  represented  in  theforward simulations? Is total ice water content conserved? If so, how is it spread amongthe valid particle sizes – equally, or is the truncated mass allocated to the smallest sizebin?

\subsubsection*{Author response}
Total IWC is not conserved in the handling of PSDs. The point raised by the reviewer has been
investigated by assessing the effect of the truncation of the IWC. The results of the analysis
are given in the figure below. As the results show, the truncation can introduce significant
errors. This, however, is only the case when the GemSnow particle is used to represent all
ice species. If it is used only to represent snow, the errors are negligible (not shown). Because
of that as well as another comment regarding the choice of the tested particles, the selection of
tested particles will be modified and the GemSnow particle will not be included.
