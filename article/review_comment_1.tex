\section{General comments}

\subsection*{Reviewer comment 1}

As noted in Section 4.2.4, the a priori assumptions do not describe reality very
well. In particular, I suspect that the information content of Dm and N0* is
highly dependent on the a priori assumptions of these two variables in the
retrieval framework. Especially with a radar measurement, since Z is sensitive
to both parameters over a wide range of the parameter space, the relative
sensitivity and therefore information content will almost entirely depend on the
relative constraints on these parameters imposed by Xa and Sa. As such it is
imperative to accurately characterize these. I understand the choice to use the
DARDAR constraints, but it’s clear from the cross-section plots that the model
ice particle concentrations vary over a much wider range than the roughly 2
orders of magnitude that Eq. 4 provides over a 220-272 K temperature range. So,
when the retrieval results are compared to model “reality”, it seems that a lot
of N0* variability is folded into Dm and this is especially evident in Figures
13 and 14. My overall concern is that it is difficult to interpret some of the
results when the model fields and the a priori assumptions differ so strongly.

\subsubsection*{Author response:}

We would like to clarify that the variation of the a priori mean with
temperature, which is given by Eq. 4, does not limit the retrieved values of
$N_0^*$ to this range. How much $N_0^*$ is allowed to vary around the a priori
mean is determined by the covariance matrix. Since the standard deviation for
$log_{10}(N_0^*)$ at each grid point was set to $2$ (c.f. Tab.~3), $N_0^*$ is
free to vary over several orders of magnitude in addition to the variation of
the a priori profile.

Furthermore, the sentence in Section~4.2.4 did not really express what we wanted
to say here. The a priori assumptions are not generally bad for the model
(after all the overall results for the first scene are good) but rather they are
insufficient to accurately describe the variability in $D_m$ and $N_0^*$.

Nonetheless, the point raised by the reviewer certainly remains valid: In
absolute terms, the interpretation of the retrieval results is dependent on the
a priori assumptions. We argue here, however, that by applying equivalent a
priori assumptions in all retrievals, we can still derive conclusions on the
benefits of the combined retrieval approach based on a relative interpretation
of the retrieval results. In particular, our results indicate that the combined
retrieval has to rely less on a priori assumptions than the radar-only
retrieval.

To address the issue raised by the reviewer, we propose the following
changes to the manuscript:

\begin{itemize}
\item To make the role of the a priori clearer the discussion of the a priori
  assumptions will be rewritten:

\begin{change}[491]
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The a priori assumptions which were used in this study were similar but not
identical to what is used in the DARDAR retrievals. Also here it should be
noted, that the presented results should not be taken to be representative for
the DARDAR product. Rather than this, the DARDAR a priori settings were chosen
since they represent well established and validated assumptions for ice cloud
retrievals and therefore should provide a reasonable starting point for the
development of a combined cloud retrieval. The fact that the a priori
assumptions used in the DARDAR retrieval do not agree with the microphysical
properties of ice and snow in the GEM model, does not say much about the general
validity of these assumptions.
}%DIFDELCMD < 

\DIFadd{The a priori assumptions used in this study are based on the DARDAR-CLOUD
product, since they represent well established and validated assumptions for ice
cloud retrievals. The role of the a priori is to complement the observations
with additional information required to make the retrieval problem tractable.
For the hydrometeor retrieval this means that the a priori determines how the
information from the observations, which alone is insufficient to accurately
determine both degrees of freedom of the PSD, is distributed between its $D_m$
and $N_0^*$ parameters. For the radar-only retrieval, this works well for cloud
systems containing both ice and snow but leads to biased retrievals in both IWC
and IWP when this is not the case, as seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:results_boxes}.
These problems could be remedied by introducing more specific a priori
assumptions. However, these will be dependent on the cloud and hydrometeor type
imposing the question of how these can be determined a priori. For the combined
retrieval, however, this may not be necessary since the increased information
content makes it less dependent on the a priori to infer the microphysical
properties of the cloud.
}\DIFaddend 
\end{change}

\item The statement from Section~4.2.4 on the a priori assumptions is corrected:

\begin{change}[544]
The forward model is non-linear and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the assumed }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{it is difficult to describe the variability
of cloud parameters using }\DIFaddend Gaussian a priori assumptions\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{do
not describe reality very well}\DIFdelend .
\end{change}

\item A paragraph is added to Section~4.2.5 emphasizing that the results should
  not be interpreted in absolute terms:

\begin{change}[549]
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Finally, it is important to consider the limitations }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{An important limitation }\DIFaddend of this study \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. The }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is its scope: The aim here was not to develop
a production-ready combined retrieval product but rather a proof-of-concept to
explore the observational approach. The retrieval }\DIFaddend results presented here \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{are }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{should
therefore not be interpreted in absolute terms. The primary results are based on
the relative performances of the three retrieval methods: Given equivalent a
priori assumptions, the combined retrieval demonstrates higher sensitivity to
the microphysical properties than the radar-only retrieval and lower errors
in terms of IWC than the passive-only retrieval.
}
\end{change}

\subsection*{Reviewer comment 2}

Forward model error is introduced when the different species present in the
model microphysics are combined into one species and when different scattering
models are used to represent the ice particles. That this is not represented in
Se could lead to over-fitting and poor convergence (I suspect this is part of
the reason why the normalized cost is much higher for the radiometer-including
retrievals). It should be relatively easy to quantify this error by re-running
the simulations with the retrieval assumptions(combining ice species, different
scattering models), and I suspect that this error term would dominate the
instrument noise term for many channels.

\subsubsection*{Author response}

It is certainly true that the simplified forward model used in the retrieval
introduces a forward modeling error and that it will likely dominate the sensor
noise. However, we do not agree with the reviewer that this is easy to quantify.
First of all, the error will not be Gaussian and will depend on the cloud
composition and the assumed particle shape, so that a more sophisticated error
model would be required to describe the error accurately. Furthermore, fitting
such a model to the test scenes would likely yield overly optimistic results as
this would mean making use of information that would not be available for real
retrieval observations.

Because of these difficulties we decided to not pursue this in this study.
However, since this is an important point to mention, the following will
be added to the discussion of the retrieval method:

\begin{change}[548]
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Some of the above-mentioned problems could likely be counteracted by accounting
for the forward model error caused by the simplified forward model applied in
the retrieval. However, finding an accurate description of this error
would require developing a suitable model for it which was deemed out of the
this studies' scope.

\subsubsection*{Author response}

The proposed changes will be adopted in the revised version of the manuscript
by introducing the following changes:

L. 252:

\textit{ In the figure, the cloud signal is displayed in $D_m$-mass density
  space and thus shows how the measured passive cloud signal varies with size
  and concentration of particles in the cloud. }


L. 449:
\textit{The results show that the combined observations can simultaneously
  constrain the size and concentration of particles in the cloud.}


In addition to this, also the following sentences which referred to the horizontal and vertical
scaling of the PSD will be changed accordingly:

L. 183:

\textit{ The retrieved scaling parameters of particle size and concentration,
  $D_m$ and $N_0^*$, are used as units for the axes of the plot so that the
  shape of the PSD becomes independent of the retrieved mass density and number
  concentration. }

L. 244:

\textit{The question that is addressed here is whether the combination of active
  and passive observations is able to constrain both the size and concentration
  of the ice particles in the cloud.}

\subsection*{Reviewer comment 3}

Line 100: A few more details on the Milbrant and Yau microphysics sheme that are relevant to this study would be helpful here. For example: What is the assumed shape(functional form) of the particle size distribution, and what are the prognostic variables(e.g., number concentration, mixing ratio)?

\subsubsection*{Author response}

To address the reviewers comment, the paragraph describing the Milbrandt-Yau microphysics scheme
has been rewritten and now reads as follows:

\textit{
The GEM model uses a two-moment scheme with six types of hydrometeors to
represent clouds and precipitation \citep{milbrandtyau05}: Two classes of liquid
hydrometeors (rain and liquid cloud) and four of frozen hydrometeors (cloud ice,
snow, hail and graupel). The particle size distribution (PSD) of each
hydrometeor class is described by a three-parameter gamma distribution. The
prognostic parameters of the two-moment scheme are the slope and intercept
parameters of the distribution, which are derived from the mixing ratios and
number densities predicted by the GEM model. The third parameter of the PSD and
the mass-size relationship of each hydrometeor class are set to fixed,
class-specific values. The parameters of the mass-size relationships are given
in Tab.~\ref{tab:species_parameters}. The masses of all ice particles in the
model are assumed to scale with a power of three, which leads to high densities
for large particles.
  }

\subsection*{Reviewer comment 4}
Line 135: Does the ARTS radar solver also provide analytic Jacobians?

\subsubsection*{Author response}
Yes, it does. This is now also mentioned in the description of the retrieval forward model:

\textit{
All simulations presented in this study were performed using Version 2.3.1245 of
the Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Simulator (ARTS, \cite{arts18}). Radar
reflectivities are computed using ARTS' built-in single-scattering radar solver,
which provides analytic Jacobians. For the ...

\subsection*{Reviewer comment 5}
Line 187: “particles” should be “particle”

\subsubsection*{Author response}

This will be corrected in the revised version of the manuscript.


\subsection{Reviewer comment 6}
Line 198: Is Dm also only retrieved at these 10 points, or just N0* (and Dm retrievedin each radar range gate as in Grecu et al. 2016)?

\subsubsection*{Author response}

$D_m$ is actually retrieved at the resolution of the GEM model scenes. To make this more clear
the following sketch has been created and will be included in the beginning of the section
describing the retrieval setup:

\begin{figure}

  quantities. Panel (a) shows the configuration used in the radar-only and
  combined retrieval. Panel (b) shows the configuration used in the passive-only
  retrieval}
\label{fig:retrieval_sketch}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Reviewer comment}
7.  Line 256:  Actually, this is only one example of how the radar and radiometer measurements can be complementary.  Even if the lines were parallel (and thus no infor-mation distinguishing size from concentration could be obtained), the radar still locates the cloud and describes its vertical structure.  One can imagine a cloud of the same ice water path and particle size at two different heights having different brightness temperatures due to changes in the water vapor absorption above the cloud – having theradar information would provide increased information content about the ice water pathin this case than the radiometer measurement alone.

\subsubsection*{Author response}
Although this is certainly one advantage of combining radar and radiometer
observations, the authors would not consider this a true synergy of the active
and passive observations since correctly locating the cloud in the atmosphere is
something that the radar can do alone. For the passive to add benefit to the
radar, the combined observations must provide additional information on the
microphysics that the radar alone does not provide.


\subsection*{Reviewer comment 8}
Table 4: Why are the values for GemSnow and GemGraupel different than in Table1?

\subsubsection*{Author response}

The differences in the reported values for GemSnow and GemGraupel were due to a mistake
made by the authors. The values defined in \citet{milbrandtyau05} differ slightly from
the ones obtained by fitting the particle data, which were then mixed up in the two tables.
In the revised version of the manuscript this will be corrected and, upon recommendation
by reviewer 2, merged into a single table. The table now looks as follows:

\begin{table}

 Line 382: should be “reference” instead of “references”

\subsubsection*{Author response}
This will be corrected in the updated version of the manuscript.

\subsection*{Reviewer comment 13}

Line  414:  How  are  the  truncated  PSDs  (using  GemSnow)  represented  in  theforward simulations? Is total ice water content conserved? If so, how is it spread amongthe valid particle sizes – equally, or is the truncated mass allocated to the smallest size bin?

\subsubsection*{Author response}
Total IWC is not conserved in the handling of PSDs. The point raised by the reviewer has been
investigated by assessing the effect of the truncation of the IWC. The results of the analysis
are given in the figure below. As the results show, the truncation can introduce significant
errors. This, however, is only the case when the GemSnow particle is used to represent all
ice species. If it is used only to represent snow, the errors are negligible (not shown). Because
of that as well as another comment regarding the choice of the tested particles, the selection of
tested particles will be modified and the GemSnow particle will not be included.
