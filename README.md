# A framework for microwave cloud retrievals

This repository contains a Python framework for retrieving clouds from microwave observations.
The main purpose of this project is to serve as a proof-of-concept for the retrieval of frozen
hydrometeors from sub-millimeter wave observations combined with radar observations.

## Dependencies

This package builds on the [ARTS](radiative-transfer.org) package for performing the simulations
of radiative transfer as well as the retrievals. In addition to that, the following Python
packages are required:
- [typhon](github.com/atmtools/typhon)
- [parts](github.com/simonpf/parts)
